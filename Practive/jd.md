# Job Description

## About the Job

Were you the kid who never stopped asking "why"? The one who took things apart just to see how they worked? If you've carried that curiosity into your data career, and now you do not just ask why, you know why, we should talk.

AI has made it easier than ever to build the wrong thing faster. The value of a good consultant has not changed: knowing what is actually worth building, getting buy-in from people who will use it, and making decisions that hold up when requirements shift. Tools change. That does not.

As a Practiv Data Engineer, you will join a team of passionate Data Cloud and AI technologists who help deliver end-to-end technology solutions for customers, from building data pipelines and data warehousing to machine learning, AI, and visualisation. You will work in a small team with a broad range of responsibilities and projects.

## Requirements

## Essential Skills

- Strong understanding of data concepts, including data modelling, data warehousing, and ETL processes, with the ability to design and implement complex data pipelines efficiently.
- Experience working with clients, either externally as a consultant or internally with other areas of your organisation.
- Experience with data services on any or all cloud platforms (e.g. Google Cloud, Databricks, or Snowflake).
- Relevant coding experience in languages such as Python and SQL or Spark, with a strong ability to write clean, efficient, and scalable code for data manipulation and system integration.

## Nice to Have

- Snowflake experience and qualifications.
- Experience with data visualisation tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or similar.
- Experience with DevOps practices and tools.
- Understanding of good data security practices.

## Candidate Profile

As a Consultant (Data Engineering), you have built a solid foundation in your data career and are looking to take the next step.

If you are a good fit and have unique skills that make you a valuable team member, applications are encouraged even if you do not tick every box. We are a growing organisation with a lot of space for innovation and good ideas.

Not essential, but we love a 100-word summary of why you are right for this role. Be yourself.
