Hiring Team
Practiv

Dear Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Data Engineer (Consultant) role at Practiv. I am a hands-on data engineering professional with 15+ years of experience delivering data platform, integration, and analytics outcomes across Australia and New Zealand.

My background aligns strongly with your requirements. I have delivered complex ETL/ELT pipelines, data warehousing and modelling solutions, and SQL/Python-based automation in cloud environments. I have also worked extensively with stakeholders to define the right solution, gain buy-in, and deliver outcomes that remain robust as requirements evolve.

In recent roles, I have led current-state assessments, enterprise data strategy execution, and governance improvements across integration-heavy environments. I bring strong capability in Power BI, data quality, and secure data practices, with practical experience translating business needs into scalable technical delivery.

I am motivated by consulting work that combines technical depth with curiosity, collaboration, and measurable impact. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Practiv's Data Cloud and AI engagements.

Yours sincerely,
Sudath Attanayake
