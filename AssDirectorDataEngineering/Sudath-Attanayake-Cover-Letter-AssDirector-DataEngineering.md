Subject: Application - Associate Program Director, Data Engineering & Science

Dear Divya Arora,

I am writing to apply for the Associate Program Director, Data Engineering & Science role. The opportunity to shape enterprise-wide data strategy, uplift analytics capability, and lead high-performing data teams in the health domain strongly aligns with my background and leadership focus.

I bring over 15 years of experience across data engineering, enterprise analytics, and modern data platform delivery in complex and regulated healthcare environments. In recent roles, I have led cross-functional teams delivering scalable data pipelines, governed analytics products, and platform modernization initiatives that improved reliability, quality, and decision support across business functions.

My technical foundation includes strong hands-on expertise in Python and SQL, along with deep experience in ETL/ELT, lakehouse architecture, and operational data platform governance. I have translated business and clinical requirements into clear delivery roadmaps, prioritized high-value initiatives, and ensured disciplined execution through strong governance, quality assurance, and risk management practices.

I have also focused on developing multidisciplinary capability across engineering and analytics teams, including mentoring, standards uplift, and promoting data literacy. This has helped teams consistently deliver trusted data products and analytics outcomes while maintaining privacy, cyber-security, and regulatory compliance expectations.

I am motivated by the chance to contribute strategic and operational leadership in this role and to help drive innovation in data engineering, data science, and analytics at enterprise scale.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support your goals.

Sincerely,
Sudath Attanayake
