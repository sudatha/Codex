Melbourne, VIC

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for data platform and database-focused roles where I can contribute deep DBA capability together with modern Azure and Microsoft Fabric engineering.

Across 15+ years in Australia and New Zealand, I have led mission-critical SQL Server environments, including serving as Principal DBA for New Zealand's national ePrescription platform operating in a 24x7 high-transaction setting. In these roles, I have been accountable for stability, performance optimization, security, capacity planning, and operational resilience where downtime and data integrity risks must be tightly controlled.

Alongside core DBA delivery, I have led platform modernization initiatives from legacy warehouse and integration estates to Azure and Fabric-based architectures. At Abano, I delivered major performance and scalability improvements across two large data warehouses spanning New Zealand and Australia. I have also designed and implemented ETL/ELT pipelines and lakehouse-aligned patterns using Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Synapse Analytics, SQL Server, and Microsoft Fabric.

My focus is to combine reliable operations with practical modernization: stronger governance, faster analytics delivery, and scalable infrastructure that supports both business reporting and long-term platform growth. I work effectively with multidisciplinary teams and stakeholders, translating technical priorities into delivery outcomes.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my DBA leadership and Fabric/Azure modernization experience can support your team.

Yours sincerely,  
Sudath Attanayake
