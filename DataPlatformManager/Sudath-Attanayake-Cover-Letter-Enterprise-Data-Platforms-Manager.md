Hiring Manager  
Enterprise Data & Platforms Manager Role

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Enterprise Data & Platforms Manager position. I bring more than 15 years of experience leading enterprise data and platform capabilities in healthcare and regulated environments, with a strong focus on stability, governance, and trusted decision-support analytics.

In recent roles at Attekus and Abano Healthcare Group, I have led platform roadmap initiatives across Microsoft Fabric, Power BI, Power Platform, and Dynamics 365-integrated data ecosystems. I have combined strategic leadership with hands-on delivery, including architecture direction, change control, release management, and risk management across production-critical services.

At Abano, I owned architecture for an enterprise analytics capability spanning 250+ endpoints and worked in the Dynamics 365 CE (CRM) integration space to align source-system data with enterprise reporting outcomes. Earlier, as a senior leader in mission-critical healthcare environments, I led large-scale migration and reliability programs, including structured release governance for an 8 TB SQL Server to Azure migration supporting national e-Prescription services.

I also bring people and stakeholder leadership that aligns with your requirements. I have coached engineers and analysts in systems analysis, documentation, and data modelling, while partnering with business leaders, technology teams, and vendors to drive platform adoption and continuous improvement.

I am especially motivated by your organisation's mission-first focus on improving long-term wellbeing through sustainable service delivery. I value the opportunity to contribute to a national not-for-profit where secure, governed platforms and high-quality insights can create measurable community impact.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my enterprise platform leadership and healthcare data background can support your goals.

Yours sincerely,

Sudath Attanayake
