Hiring Manager
Grampians Health & St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne EMR Program

Subject: Application - Project Manager, Integration Strategy

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Project Manager, Integration Strategy role within the Grampians Health and St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne EMR Program. I offer 16+ years of Health IT experience delivering integration, migration, and go live outcomes for patient and health data systems in regulated healthcare environments.

My healthcare background includes:

- Northland District Health Board, New Zealand (DBA, 2003-2007): supported clinical data migration and go live activities during legacy-to-SQL modernization.
- SimplHealth, Auckland (Senior DBA, Mar 2013-Nov 2016): delivered HL7 data exchange of electronic patient data between GP systems and pharmacy systems and supported national-level go live cutovers.
- Whanau Tahi Limited, Auckland (Senior Database Administrator, Oct 2016-Sep 2021): primary DBA for New Zealand's national e-Prescription platform, delivered HL7 electronic patient data exchange between GP and pharmacy systems, and led major national go live cutovers.
- Abano Healthcare Group, Auckland (Senior DBA, Sep 2021-Nov 2022): supported healthcare data operations and reliability uplift for core business and clinical reporting services.
- Abano Healthcare Group, Melbourne (Data and Analytics Architect, Nov 2022-Apr 2025): owned enterprise integration architecture across 250+ endpoints, coordinating dependencies across internal teams, third party platforms, and external vendors.

I have hands-on experience designing integration architecture, planning data conversion and cutover, and managing complex stakeholder coordination across business, technical, and vendor groups. I am comfortable leading multi-site delivery and building practical implementation plans to exchange mission-critical data between EMR and third party systems safely and reliably.

I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to a shared EMR across rural, regional, and metropolitan services, and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support this program.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Sudath Attanayake
