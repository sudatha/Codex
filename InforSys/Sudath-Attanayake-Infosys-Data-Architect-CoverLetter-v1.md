Hiring Manager
Infosys
Melbourne

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Data Architect / Senior Data Modeler - Azure Synapse / Data Vault role at Infosys.

I bring 15+ years of experience in data engineering and architecture, with strong hands-on delivery across enterprise data modelling, EDW design, and cloud data platform modernization. My background includes conceptual, logical, and physical data modelling, dimensional modelling, and governance-aligned delivery in complex enterprise environments.

In recent roles, I have led data architecture and modelling initiatives across Azure ecosystems, including Synapse-aligned patterns, ADLS, and ADF-based integration. I have delivered data platform transformations with clear focus on lineage, auditability, metadata standards, and performance optimization through partitioning, distribution, and indexing strategies.

I am comfortable in client-facing consulting environments and have consistently partnered with senior stakeholders to shape and execute data and AI transformation initiatives. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute this capability to Infosys and support your clients through high-impact data transformation programs.

Yours sincerely,
Sudath Attanayake
