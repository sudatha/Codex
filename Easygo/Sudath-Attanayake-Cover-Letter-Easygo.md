Hiring Manager  
Easygo

Subject: Application - Senior Data Engineer / Data Platform Role

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for your Data Engineering role. Your vision strongly resonated with me, especially the line: "If you're someone who loves tackling large-scale, greenfield solutions and shaping the future of data, you'll fit right in." That is exactly the type of work I have built my career around.

I bring 15+ years of data platform delivery experience, including enterprise architecture ownership, large-scale pipeline engineering, and production reliability across complex environments. Most recently, I led data platform initiatives focused on lakehouse design, scalable ETL/ELT delivery, and operational optimization. At Abano Healthcare Group, I owned architecture for a platform supporting 250+ data endpoints and helped enable trusted self-service analytics across finance, payroll, and clinical domains.

My hands-on background is strongest in Azure Data Factory, Microsoft Purview, Python, SQL, and PySpark. The orchestration, governance, and infrastructure patterns I have implemented are directly transferable to AWS-centric stacks, including AWS Glue, Airflow-style workflow orchestration, and Terraform-based automation. I have consistently focused on the same outcomes your role targets: reliable and observable pipelines, strong governance controls, secure data access, and cost-efficient scaling.

Beyond technical delivery, I value engineering excellence and team impact. I actively drive better system design, code quality, documentation standards, and collaborative code reviews. I also enjoy mentoring engineers and working closely with stakeholders to turn strategic priorities into measurable business outcomes.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Easygo's data platform mission and help build the next generation of scalable, high-trust data capabilities.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Sudath Attanayake
