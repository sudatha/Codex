Hiring Manager  
JG King  
Port Melbourne, VIC

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Head of Data and Integration role. I bring 15+ years of experience across data engineering, integration, BI, and enterprise data platform leadership, with recent hands-on architecture ownership in Australia.

In my recent role as Data and Analytics Architect at Abano Healthcare Group, I led modernization of legacy data warehouse environments to Microsoft Fabric and Azure-aligned platforms. This included current-state assessment, detailed integration mapping, and impact and risk evaluation across critical endpoints including Finance (D365 F&O), Payroll, CRM, and SharePoint. I also contributed as a senior member of the Change Advisory Committee (CAB), helping ensure delivery quality and operational stability.

At Attekus, I led data platform and integration architecture in a strategic individual contributor role, implemented bronze/silver/gold architecture patterns, improved data quality controls, and strengthened Power BI delivery through semantic model uplift, DAX optimization, refresh governance, and performance tuning. Across roles, I have consistently partnered with senior stakeholders and vendors to deliver practical outcomes through strong governance, clear documentation, and reliable execution.

Your role aligns strongly with my background in enterprise data architecture, ETL/ELT orchestration, master data management-aligned practices, and integration leadership across complex system landscapes. I am confident I can help establish and scale a trusted data foundation that supports operational excellence and long-term competitive advantage.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support JG King's data and integration strategy.

Yours sincerely,
