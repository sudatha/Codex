Hiring Manager

Subject: Application - Group Enterprise Architect

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Group Enterprise Architect role. I bring 15+ years of architecture and platform leadership experience across multi-entity, fast-changing environments in Australia and New Zealand, with strong capability in Azure-centric enterprise ecosystems.

In recent roles, I have shaped target state architecture, defined standards and governance, and translated business strategy into practical technology roadmaps. I am comfortable operating through influence without direct line management, working closely with CIO-level stakeholders, senior leaders, delivery teams, and vendors to drive high-quality outcomes.

My experience includes architecture oversight across applications, integration, infrastructure, security, and data, while remaining hands-on in complex solution design and critical technical decisions. I have led platform convergence and simplification initiatives to reduce duplication, technical debt, and operational complexity, and I have supported integration planning for evolving business structures and modernization programs.

I also bring strong delivery pragmatism. I balance long-term architecture direction with practical execution support, including governance that enables speed rather than bureaucracy, risk-based decision making, and clear standards that teams can apply in day-to-day delivery.

This role's combination of enterprise strategy, acquisition-driven change, and high accountability is exactly the environment where I add value. I am available for a 5-day onsite working model and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can support your Group technology agenda.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Sudath Attanayake
