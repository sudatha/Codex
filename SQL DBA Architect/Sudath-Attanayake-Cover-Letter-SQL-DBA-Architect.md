Hiring Manager

Subject: Application - SQL DBA Architect

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the SQL DBA Architect opportunity. I bring over 15 years of hands-on experience in SQL Server administration, database architecture, migration delivery, and production reliability improvement across healthcare and enterprise environments.

My background includes end-to-end ownership of SQL platforms, including performance tuning, indexing strategy, partitioning, backup and recovery readiness, incident response, and operational support. I have led complex migration programs from legacy and on-premises SQL Server environments to modern Azure-based platforms with strong governance, minimal downtime, and controlled cutover execution.

At Whanau Tahi, I led an 8 TB SQL Server to Azure migration using replication-based cutover, with pre-migration validation, staged transition planning, and post-cutover reconciliation. At SimplHealth, I delivered SQL Server-backed integration and reporting workloads, including HL7 real-time e-Prescription ingestion jobs and Ministry of Health reporting feeds, while improving query performance and data quality controls.

In addition to technical execution, I work closely with business and engineering stakeholders to align platform decisions with reliability, compliance, and cost-efficiency outcomes. I am comfortable leading design decisions, handling technical escalations, and mentoring teams to improve delivery standards.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my SQL DBA and migration expertise to your team. Thank you for your consideration, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss my suitability for the role.

Sincerely,
Sudath Attanayake
