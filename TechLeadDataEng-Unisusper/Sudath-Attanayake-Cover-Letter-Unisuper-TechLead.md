Hiring Manager
UniSuper

Subject: Application - Technical Lead, Data Engineering

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Technical Lead, Data Engineering role at UniSuper. The opportunity to provide hands-on technical leadership while shaping robust, scalable, and secure data platforms strongly aligns with my experience and leadership style.

I bring over 15 years of experience delivering enterprise data platforms in complex, regulated environments, with deep hands-on capability in Microsoft SQL Server, Azure data services, Python, SQL, and Spark-based engineering. In recent roles, I have led engineers day-to-day while remaining directly engaged in solution design, implementation, production support, and continuous improvement.

I have consistently translated business requirements and architecture into practical technical designs and high-quality delivery. My background includes building and operating scalable batch and near real-time data pipelines, strengthening CI/CD and DevOps practices, improving engineering standards, and driving disciplined operational readiness. I have also acted as a technical escalation point for complex incidents, led root cause analysis, and implemented sustainable fixes to improve reliability and supportability.

At enterprise scale, I focus on non-functional excellence, including performance, availability, security, and cost-aware design. I have worked across cross-functional application, integration, and platform teams to deliver cohesive end-to-end outcomes, while mentoring engineers across varying levels of experience and uplifting modern engineering practices.

I am excited by UniSuper's focus on strong engineering practice, pragmatic delivery, and continuous improvement, and I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your data platform evolution.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support UniSuper's data engineering goals.

Sincerely,
Sudath Attanayake
