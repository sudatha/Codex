Hands-on experience with data modeling (dimensional, Data Vault, or data mesh), ETL/ELT pipelines, and data quality frameworks with demonstrated success in delivering production data systems.
Technical Depth & Breadth: Solid understanding of data engineering technologies (Spark, SQL, Python), cloud-native data services, data governance tools, and CI/CD practices for data platforms. Familiarity with analytical and AI/ML workloads and their data platform requirements; ability to evaluate trade-offs between different architectural approaches and make sound technical decisions.
Communication & Collaboration: Proven ability to communicate complex technical concepts to diverse audiences including executives, business stakeholders, and technical teams. Experience working in cross-functional teams, mentoring junior team members, and collaborating with architects, engineers, and consultants in fast-paced client environments. Strong problem-solving skills with ability to balance technical excellence with pragmatic, business-focused solutions.
Leadership & Influence: Demonstrated ability to lead and inspire cross-functional teams, mentor talent, communicate technical concepts to non-technical executives, and navigate complex stakeholder environments in fast-paced, regulated industries. Experience balancing commercial objectives with delivery excellence and building high-performing data delivery practices.
