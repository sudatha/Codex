Hiring Manager  
UniSuper  
Melbourne, VIC

## Application: Technical Lead - Data Engineering

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Technical Lead - Data Engineering role at UniSuper. I bring 15+ years of hands-on experience delivering and modernising enterprise data platforms across Azure and SQL Server environments, with a strong focus on engineering quality, reliability, and business-aligned outcomes.

In recent roles at Attekus and Abano Healthcare Group, I led data platform modernisation initiatives and provided day-to-day technical leadership across integration, data engineering, and analytics delivery. This included work with Azure Databricks, Spark, ADLS Gen2, Delta Lake, Azure Data Factory, and SQL Server, alongside governance and CI/CD uplift. I have consistently translated business requirements and architecture direction into practical technical designs and implementation plans that improve supportability, scalability, and performance.

I am comfortable acting as the escalation point for complex production issues and driving root cause analysis through to sustainable fixes. I have also led improvements in engineering standards, operational readiness, and delivery discipline, including documentation, release governance, and cross-team collaboration.

UniSuper's focus on robust, scalable, and secure data platforms strongly aligns with the way I work as a technical lead. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your data engineering capability and help deliver reliable, high-quality platform outcomes for members and stakeholders.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to discussing how my experience can support UniSuper's data platform objectives.

Sincerely,  
Sudath Attanayake
