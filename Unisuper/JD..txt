You will be accountable for:

Providing technical leadership and day-to-day guidance to data engineers, building strong engineering practices and continuous learning
Translating business requirements and solution architecture into high-quality technical designs and implementations
Owning solution integrity (performance, reliability, supportability) across the full lifecycle
Contributing to platform evolution with focus on efficiency, reuse, scalability and security
Driving consistent engineering standards, CI/CD adoption and delivery improvements
Partnering across application, platform and integration teams for cohesive end-to-end outcomes

What You'll Do

Lead the design, development, testing and deployment of data solutions across Microsoft SQL Server and Azure
Be the technical escalation point for complex engineering tasks and production incidents
Ensure solutions meet NFRs (performance, availability, security and supportability)
Review designs and code for standards, quality and maintainability
Mentor and coach engineers across varying experience levels; uplift capability in modern tools and practices
Drive robust root cause analysis and deliver sustainable fixes to production data issues
Improve engineering discipline: documentation, testing, operational readiness and change management compliance
Embed cost-aware design, guiding cost optimisation and financial efficiency
Evolve CI/CD pipelines, automation and DevOps practices
Provide pragmatic data modelling guidance (fit-for-purpose, aligned to reporting/analytics needs)
Improve non-production testing/environment strategies (automated refresh/validation/data quality checks aligned to production changes)
Challenge ways of working to improve reliability, delivery speed and member outcomes
