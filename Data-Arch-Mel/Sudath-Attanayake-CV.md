## 100-Word Summary - Why I Am a Strong Fit
I bring a consultant mindset with deep engineering capability. I have designed and delivered data pipelines, warehouse modernisation programs, and analytics platforms in complex multi-stakeholder environments. My strengths include SQL, Python, ETL/ELT design, governance, and communication with technical and non-technical stakeholders. I enjoy solving the right problem, not just the fastest one, and I am comfortable working in small teams with broad responsibilities.
