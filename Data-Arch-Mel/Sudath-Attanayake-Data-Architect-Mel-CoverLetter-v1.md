Hiring Manager
Melbourne

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Data Architect contract role in Melbourne.

I bring 15+ years of experience across enterprise data architecture, governance, and platform modernization, with strong hands-on delivery in large and complex environments. My background aligns strongly with your requirements for a core Data Architecture profile that can lead architectural direction, maintain standards, and work closely with stakeholders.

In recent roles, I have led architecture functions, defined enterprise data architecture frameworks, and established governance and documentation standards to improve quality, consistency, and delivery outcomes. I have also provided architecture guidance across data platform and integration initiatives, while partnering with business and technical teams to align decisions with strategic priorities.

I am confident I can add value immediately in this long-term hybrid engagement by providing strong architecture leadership, practical governance execution, and clear stakeholder communication.

Yours sincerely,
Sudath Attanayake
