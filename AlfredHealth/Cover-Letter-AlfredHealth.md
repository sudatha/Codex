Hiring Manager  
Bayside Health / Alfred Health  
Melbourne, VIC

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for this role because my long-standing interest in working with health data is exactly what caught my attention to this job.

I bring 15+ years of experience across DBA leadership, data systems engineering, and platform modernization to Microsoft Fabric and Azure infrastructure. I have consistently delivered secure, high-performance data platforms in regulated healthcare settings, with strong focus on data quality, governance, and operational reliability.

At Abano Healthcare Group (New Zealand and Australia), I led health-data platform and warehouse modernization work, including major performance and reliability improvements across two large data warehouses supporting clinical-adjacent and operational reporting.

At Whanau Tahi, I served as Principal DBA for New Zealand's national ePrescription platform, operating a 24x7 highly critical, high-transaction environment handling sensitive patient and medication data. I also led an 8 TB SQL Server to Azure migration with controlled cutover and minimal downtime.

Earlier at Northland District Health Board, I supported clinical data migration and modernized legacy health applications to SQL Server platforms, strengthening reliability and reporting capability in hospital and health service contexts.

This combination of hands-on DBA depth and proven platform modernization to Fabric and Azure aligns strongly with your needs across clinical registry data systems, dashboards, and analytics delivery.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Yours sincerely,  
Sudath Attanayake
