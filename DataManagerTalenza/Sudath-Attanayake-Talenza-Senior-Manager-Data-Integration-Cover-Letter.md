Hiring Manager  
Talenza Melbourne

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Manager, Data & Integration role advertised by Talenza. This opportunity strongly aligns with my background leading enterprise data and integration outcomes while staying hands-on in delivery. Across 15+ years in Australia and New Zealand, I have built and uplifted data platforms, improved reporting ecosystems, and delivered integration programs that balance technical quality with measurable business value.

Most recently, as Data Platform Lead at Attekus (Melbourne), I led architecture and delivery direction across data platform, integration, and reporting capabilities. I assessed current-state environments, identified duplication and quality risks, and drove targeted uplift actions with clear priorities. I implemented Microsoft Fabric Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), improved governance guardrails, and delivered Power BI uplift across DAX performance, semantic model design, and deployment pipeline maturity.

In my prior role as Data and Analytics Architect at Abano Healthcare Group, I owned architecture for analytics and integration across 250+ endpoints. I defined modernization roadmaps, designed migration paths from legacy warehouses to Fabric-aligned platforms, and strengthened ETL/ELT patterns using SQL and Azure services including ADF/SSIS-aligned delivery contexts. I also bring practical experience supporting Master Data Management principles, data quality controls, metadata and lineage practices, and stakeholder engagement across business, technology, and vendor groups.

What attracts me to this role is the chance to build the data function from the ground up as the inaugural data leader, reporting to the CIO and setting a long-term enterprise direction. I am comfortable operating autonomously, setting strategy, and personally delivering foundational outcomes including platform architecture, dimensional modeling, governance standards, and trusted self-service analytics.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help establish and scale your enterprise data capability.

Yours sincerely,  
Sudath Attanayake
