Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Senior Manager, Data & Integration role. My background in data engineering, integration, and analytics aligns strongly with your requirements, and I am comfortable combining strategy with hands-on delivery.

I have focused on enterprise data platform uplift, ETL/ELT design, SQL-based engineering, and Power BI capability uplift including DAX, semantic models, and deployment pipelines. I also bring experience with governance, data quality, and delivery leadership across complex stakeholder environments.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help deliver your data and integration roadmap.

Yours sincerely,
Sudath Attanayake
