Senior Manager, Data & Integration
Talenza - Melbourne | Permanent | Hybrid

Talenza Melbourne is partnering with a well-established, mid-sized organisation to appoint their first Senior Manager, Data & Integration.

This is a newly created, high-impact role and a genuine opportunity to build a Data function from the ground up. Reporting to the CIO and operating alongside the IT leadership team, you will take full ownership of enterprise data strategy, architecture, and analytics capability.

This role will suit a passionate, hands-on data leader who enjoys building platforms, not just designing them.


The Opportunity
As the inaugural data hire, you will define the roadmap and personally deliver the foundational data environment. Your mandate is clear: assess the current landscape, uplift capability, and establish a scalable, governed, enterprise-grade data platform.


Key Responsibilities
Assess & Optimise the Current State

Review the existing data landscape, reporting environment, and system integrations.

Identify inefficiencies, duplication, and data quality risks.

Deliver a clear, prioritised uplift roadmap focused on operational efficiency and business value.

Build a New Enterprise Data Warehouse / Lakehouse

Architect and implement a modern, scalable data warehouse or lakehouse (Azure-preferred).

Design dimensional models aligned to operational and project reporting.

Implement structured bronze, silver, and gold data layers with clear lifecycle controls.

Maximise Value from Power BI

Own and uplift an established Power BI environment (multiple workspaces and extensive DAX models).

Improve governance, modelling standards, performance, and deployment processes.

Enable trusted, scalable self-service analytics across the business.

Strengthen Integration & Master Data Practices

Establish Master Data Management (MDM) frameworks and governance standards.

Design and maintain robust ETL/ELT pipelines across multiple core systems.

Lead data workstreams for system implementations and migrations.


About You
You are a technically strong and commercially aware data professional who enjoys staying hands-on while setting strategic direction.

You will bring:

Demonstrable experience (ideally 8+ years) in data engineering, BI, or data management roles.

Proven experience building enterprise data warehouses or lakehouses.

Deep expertise in SQL and ETL/ELT development (ADF, SSIS or similar).

Advanced Power BI capability (DAX, semantic models, deployment pipelines).

Experience implementing Master Data Management principles.

Strong stakeholder engagement skills and the ability to operate autonomously.


Why Apply?
First data hire - build the function your way.

High visibility role reporting directly to the CIO.

Genuine strategic impact with hands-on ownership.

Hybrid working environment with a great culture.
