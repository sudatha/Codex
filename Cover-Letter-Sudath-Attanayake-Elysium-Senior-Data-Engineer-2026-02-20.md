Hiring Manager
Elysium Digital
Melbourne, VIC

**Re: Senior Data Engineer**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Data Engineer role at Elysium Digital. With more than 15 years of experience delivering enterprise data and analytics platforms, I bring strong technical leadership and hands-on engineering capability across modern Azure and Lakehouse environments.

Most recently as Data Platform Lead at Attekus, I owned end-to-end delivery of data platform initiatives using Microsoft Fabric, Medallion architecture, and Azure SQL integration. I led cross-functional delivery across architecture, engineering, and analytics priorities, with a focus on scalability, governance, and business outcomes.

Across recent roles, I have designed and delivered production data pipelines and platform solutions using Python, PySpark, SQL, Azure Data Factory, Spark, Delta Lake, and Event Hub. I have also worked extensively with Azure DevOps and GitHub to support structured delivery, release governance, and engineering quality. My data modelling experience includes Kimball-aligned warehouse design, and I have partnered directly with business and technical stakeholders to translate requirements into reliable, high-value analytics capability.

I am particularly interested in this opportunity because it combines technical leadership, modern data engineering, and consulting-style delivery across multiple industries. I enjoy mentoring engineers, setting practical standards, and scaling proven solutions from concept to production.

Thank you for your consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Elysium Digital's data and analytics capability growth.

Yours sincerely,

Sudath Attanayake
