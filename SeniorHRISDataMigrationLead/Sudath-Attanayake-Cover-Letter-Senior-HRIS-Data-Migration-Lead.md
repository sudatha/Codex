Hiring Manager

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Senior HRIS Data Migration Lead opportunity. I bring over 15 years of data migration, database, and platform delivery experience across healthcare and government environments in Australia and New Zealand, with deep hands-on leadership in complex enterprise migration programs.

In recent roles at Attekus and Abano Healthcare Group, I have led migration strategy and delivery across multi-domain systems, including data extraction, transformation, loading, quality controls, reconciliation, cutover planning, and post-go-live stabilisation. I have worked closely with stakeholders and delivery vendors to align technical migration execution with business and operational outcomes.

My background includes extensive healthcare data exposure, including HL7-aligned integration contexts, and delivery in highly regulated, mission-critical environments. I have also supported HR and payroll integrated platforms and am ready to lead large-scale SuccessFactors migration work with disciplined governance, risk management, and delivery assurance.

I would value the opportunity to contribute this experience to your organisation and help deliver a safe, accurate, and efficient HRIS migration outcome.

Yours sincerely,

Sudath Attanayake
