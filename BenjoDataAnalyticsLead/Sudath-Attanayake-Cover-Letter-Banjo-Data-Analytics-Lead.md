Hiring Manager  
Banjo Loans

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Data and Analytics Lead role at Banjo. I am excited by the opportunity to join a high-growth SME non-bank lender and own the automated credit decisioning and data platform capability that supports strong commercial outcomes.

I bring 15+ years of hands-on data platform and analytics leadership experience in regulated, high-accountability environments. Across recent roles, I have combined strategic ownership with day-to-day technical delivery, including building Python and SQL data pipelines, designing scalable Azure-based platforms, implementing governance and release controls, and enabling trusted reporting for executive stakeholders.

I am comfortable operating in a player-coach model. I enjoy being close to the detail while setting direction and standards, and I have a strong track record of uplifting capability across engineers and analysts through practical mentoring and high delivery discipline.

My background aligns strongly with your core requirements:

- Hands-on development with Python, SQL, and modern cloud data platforms (Azure, Databricks-aligned/Spark patterns).
- Data platform and warehouse design for reliable, high-quality pipelines, strong observability, and operational resilience.
- Governance-led delivery across change control, risk management, release management, access control, data security, and privacy.
- Stakeholder partnership across finance, operations, product, and technology teams to deliver clear, actionable analytics.
- Executive-ready reporting support with a focus on accuracy, timeliness, and measurable business impact.

I am particularly motivated by Banjo's model of combining technology, data-driven decisioning, and practical service to support Australian SMEs. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your automated credit assessment roadmap and help scale a robust, insight-led data capability as the business grows.

Thank you for your consideration. I would value the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Banjo's next stage of growth.

Yours sincerely,

Sudath Attanayake
