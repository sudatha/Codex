Re: Head of Data Platforms - Financial Services

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Head of Data Platforms role. I bring over 15 years of experience leading enterprise data platforms, architecture, and modernization programs across complex and regulated environments, with strong capability in platform strategy, cloud delivery, and operational excellence.

In my recent role as Data Platform Lead at Attekus, I led enterprise platform strategy using Microsoft Fabric, Lakehouse, and Medallion architecture patterns. I introduced Fabric Mirroring from Azure SQL to improve analytics readiness and supported performance and cost optimization across ingestion, transformation, and reporting layers.

Previously, as Data and Analytics Architect at Abano Healthcare Group, I was the architecture owner for an enterprise analytics platform supporting 250+ data endpoints across finance, payroll, and clinical domains. I defined architecture standards, governed enterprise data models, led modernization of legacy warehouse patterns, and coordinated delivery with internal teams and external technology vendors and partners. This included aligning delivery priorities to business outcomes and balancing platform quality, scalability, and cost efficiency.

I have also led critical migration and reliability programs, including large SQL Server to Azure migrations, integration modernization, and production cutover in mission-critical environments. Across these roles, I have consistently partnered with executives and senior stakeholders to position data as a strategic asset and deliver measurable value through trusted analytics platforms.

I am particularly interested in this opportunity because of its enterprise scale, leadership scope, and focus on data platform strategy, advanced analytics, and commercial accountability. I am confident I can contribute strongly to your roadmap by combining hands-on platform depth with executive-level delivery leadership.

Thank you for your consideration. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your goals for enterprise data platform transformation.

Yours sincerely,

Sudath Attanayake
